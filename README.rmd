Here is a description of each file in the repository:
	:: mushrooms.csv :: the mushroom data set from the UCI Machine Learning repository, downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification)
	:: EagerBrian_decisiontree.py :: implementations of the DecisionTree algirhtm (Algorithm 19.1) and the RandomForest algorithm (Algorithm 22.5) from "Data Mining and Machine Learning" (2nd Edition) by Zaki and Meira.
	:: Edibility_of_mushrooms.ipynb :: the main code for the project, that reads mushrooms.csv into a pandas.DataFrame and in which all models are built.  Imports classes from EagerBrian_decisiontree.py.  Must be in the same directory as both mushrooms.csv and EagerBrian_decisiontree.py to run correctly.
	:: Edibility_of_mushrooms.html :: an html rendering of Edibility_of_mushrooms.ipynb
	:: EagerBrian_EdibilityOfMushrooms.pptx :: a narrated (audio) PowerPoint presentation summarizing this project.
	:: EagerBrian_TermProjectPaper.docx :: A written paper in APA format describing the analysis performed in this project and the insights gained by it.
	:: EagerBrian_TermProjectPaper.pdf :: A PDF version of EagerBrian_TeramProjectPaper.docx
